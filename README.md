Problem Sets
============= 

- **Problem Set 0 - Development Environment and Configuration**

  In this problem set, I set up the basics of my development <br>
  environment and wrote some simple scripts to ensure my enviroment <br>
  was properly configured. You can view the pdf of the assignment [here]().
